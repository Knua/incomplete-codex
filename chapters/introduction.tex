	Let's face it: mathematics is hard.
	
	But as a computer scientist, you need to know the principle of mathematics. And we know, it's not easy. The many mathematical principles are dispersed throughout many areas of mathematics, whether it is number theory, calculus, analysis, or statistics.
	
	This book aims to give some help to computer scientists who are tired of searching the highly dispersed information on the net or in the books. This includes the theoretical parts of computer science, such as graph, language, and complexity theories.
	
	In the first part, mathematical preliminaries, we see the important parts from many parts of mathematics as mentioned above. This may not be directly related to any algorithms, but this will serve as a basis for many theoretical parts of computer science.
	
	In the second part, theory-heavy parts of computer science are described as mathematically precise as possible.
