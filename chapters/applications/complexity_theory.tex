        \begin{defn}[Asymptotic notation] \label{def_bigo}
            Let $f$ and $g$ be two functions from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$. Then we say: \begin{itemize}
                \item $f=O(g)$ if there is a constant $c$ such that $f(n) \leq c \cdot g(n)$ for every sufficiently large $n$. That is, $n>N$ for some $N$.
                \item $f=\Omega(g)$ if $g=O(f)$.
                \item $f=\Theta(g)$ if $f=O(g)$ and $g=O(f)$.
                \item $f=o(g)$ if for every constant $c>0$, $f(n) < c \cdot g(n)$ for every sufficiently large $n$.
                \item $f=\omega(g)$ if $g=o(f)$.
            \end{itemize}

        $\mathbf{P}$ is the set of boolean function computable in time $O(n^c)$ for some constant $c>0$.

    \section {Reduction}
        Is there a polynomial-time algorithm for a given decision problem? Computer scientists are interested in this question because if there is one, it is usually a small-degree polynomial like $O(n^2)$ or $O(n^5)$. Some problems have a special property that if the problem has a polynomial-time algorithm, then several other problems do.
        
        \begin{defn}[Polynomial-time Karp reduction] \label{def_poly_karp}
            A problem $A \subseteq \strs$ is \emph{polynomial-time Karp reducible} to $B \subseteq \strs$, denoted $A \leq_p B$, if there is a polynomial-time computable function $f: \strs \rightarrow \strs$ such that for every $x \in \strs$, $x \in A$ iff $f(x) \in B$.
        \end{defn}
        
        The intuitive meaning is that a problem of $A$ can be "reduced" to a problem of $B$, and if we can solve $B$ in polynomial-time, then we can solve $A$ in polynomial-time too.
        
        \begin{defn}[NP-complete] \label{def_npc}
            A problem $A$ is \emph{NP-hard} if every problem in $\mathbf{NP}$ is polynomial-time reducible to $A$, and \emph{NP-complete} if $A$ is NP-hard and NP.
        \end{defn}
        
        \begin{thm} \label{thm_leqp_transitive}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item[]
                \item If $A \leq_p B$ and $B \leq_p C$, then $A \leq_p C$.
                \item An NP-complete problem $A$ is in $\mathbf{P}$ iff $\mathbf{P}=\mathbf{NP}$.
                \item If $A \leq_p B$ and $A$ is NP-hard, then $B$ is NP-hard.
            \end{enumerate}
            %If $A \leq_p B$ and $B \leq_p C$, then $A \leq_p C$. Also, an NP-complete problem $A$ is in $\mathbf{P}$ iff $\mathbf{P}=\mathbf{NP}$.
        \end{thm}
        
        \begin{proof}
            (1) Let $f$ be a reduction from $A$ to $B$ with polynomial time $p(n)$, and $g$ from $B$ to $C$ with $q(n)$. Then $g \circ f$ is a reduction from $A$ to $C$ with polynomial time $q(p(n))$.
            
            (2) Suppose $A$ is NP-complete and in $\mathbf{P}$. Then any problem $B$ in $\mathbf{NP}$ can be polynomial-time reduced to $A$, so transitivity implies that $B$ is polynomial-time computable. The converse is trivial.
            
            (3) Any problem $C$ in $\mathbf{NP}$ can be polynomial-time reduced to $A$. Transitivity implies that $C$ can be polynomial-time reduced to $B$.
        \end{proof}
        
        Now the obvious question is, does such a strong problem actually exist? The answer is yes, and a lot of important problems are NP-complete.
        
        (TODO: SAT)
        
        Having proven that SAT is NP-hard, more problems can be proven NP-hard if we can reduce SAT to those problems in polynomial-time. Here are only a tiny fraction of the NP-complete problems:
        
        \begin{defn}[NP-complete problems] \label{def_npc_examples} \begin{itemize}
            \item[]
            \item The \emph{3-SAT problem} is a SAT problem where each clause contains exactly 3 variables.
            \item Given a graph $G$ and an integer $0 \leq k \leq |V(G)|$, the \emph{clique problem} asks whether there is a complete induced subgraph of $G$ with size at least $k$.
            \item The \emph{independent set problem} asks whether there is a subset $S$ of $V(G)$ with size at least $k$ such that no two vertices in $S$ are adjacent, and 0 otherwise.
            \item The \emph{vertex cover problem} asks whether there is a subset $S$ of $V(G)$ with size at most $k$ such that each edge is adjacent to at least one vertex in $S$.
            \item The \emph{chromatic number problem} asks whether $G$ is 3-colorable.
            \item Given a set $S$ of integers and an integer $k$, the \emph{subset sum problem} asks whether there is a subset of $S$ whose sum of elements equals $k$.
            \item Given an $n \times m$ matrix $A$ and an $n \times 1$ matrix $b$ of integers, the \emph{integer programming problem} asks whether there is an $m \times 1$ matrix $x$ of integers such that each element of $Ax+b$ is non-negative.
        \end{itemize}
        \end{defn}
        
        \begin{thm} \label{thm_npc_examples}
            All problems in \ref{def_npc_examples} are NP-complete.
        \end{thm}
